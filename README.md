## Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String
```  // Setup
const lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
const secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length-2]; // Change this line
```
# Nest one Array within Another Array
```const teams = [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]];
```
# Access Array Data with Indexes
We can access the data inside arrays using indexes.

Array indexes are written in the same bracket notation that strings use, except that instead of specifying a character, they are specifying an entry in the array. Like strings, arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first element in an array has an index of 0.


Example

const array = [50, 60, 70];
console.log(array[0]);
const data = array[1];
The console.log(array[0]) prints 50, and data has the value 60.

``` const myArray = [50, 60, 70];
let myData = myArray[0]
```
# Modify Array Data With Indexes

Modify the data stored at index 0 of myArray to a value of 45.
```const myArray = [18, 64, 99];
myArray[0] = 45
```

# Access Multi-Dimensional Arrays With Indexes
One way to think of a multi-dimensional array, is as an array of arrays. When you use brackets to access your array, the first set of brackets refers to the entries in the outer-most (the first level) array, and each additional pair of brackets refers to the next level of entries inside.

Example
```
const arr = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
  [[10, 11, 12], 13, 14]
];
```

const subarray = arr[3];
const nestedSubarray = arr[3][0];
const element = arr[3][0][1];
In this example, subarray has the value [[10, 11, 12], 13, 14], nestedSubarray has the value [10, 11, 12], and element has the value 11 .

# Manipulate Arrays With push()

Push ["dog", 3] onto the end of the myArray variable.
```const myArray = [["John", 23], ["cat", 2]];
myArray.push(["dog", 3])
```
# Manipulate Arrays With pop()
Use the .pop() function to remove the last item from myArray and assign the popped off value to a new variable, removedFromMyArray.
```const myArray = [["John", 23], ["cat", 2]];

const removedFromMyArray = myArray.pop()
```
# Manipulate Arrays With shift()
Use the .shift() function to remove the first item from myArray and assign the "shifted off" value to a new variable, removedFromMyArray.
```const myArray = [["John", 23], ["dog", 3]];
const removedFromMyArray = myArray.shift()
```
# Manipulate Arrays With unshift()
Add ["Paul", 35] to the beginning of the myArray variable using unshift().
```const myArray = [["John", 23], ["dog", 3]];
myArray.shift();
myArray.unshift(["Paul", 35]);
```
# Shopping List

Create a shopping list in the variable myList. The list should be a multi-dimensional array containing several sub-arrays.

The first element in each sub-array should contain a string with the name of the item. The second element should be a number representing the quantity i.e.

```const myList = [
  ["Chocolate Bar", 1],
  ["Cookies", 2],
  ["Protein", 15],
  ["Coconut Water", 15],
  ["Oat Milk", 15],
];
```
# Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions
Create a function called reusableFunction which prints the string Hi World to the dev console.
Call the function.
``` function reusableFunction(){
  console.log("Hi World");
}
reusableFunction();
```
# Passing Values to Functions with Arguments
Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.

Here is a function with two parameters, param1 and param2:

function testFun(param1, param2) {
  console.log(param1, param2);
}
Then we can call testFun like this: testFun("Hello", "World");. We have passed two string arguments, Hello and World. Inside the function, param1 will equal the string Hello and param2 will equal the string World. Note that you could call testFun again with different arguments and the parameters would take on the value of the new arguments.

Create a function called functionWithArgs that accepts two arguments and outputs their sum to the dev console.
Call the function with two numbers as arguments.
```function functionWithArgs(a,b) {
console.log(a+b);
}
functionWithArgs(1,2);
functionWithArgs(7,9);
```
# Return a Value from a Function with Return
We can pass values into a function with arguments. You can use a return statement to send a value back out of a function.

Example

function plusThree(num) {
  return num + 3;
}

const answer = plusThree(5);
answer has the value 8.

plusThree takes an argument for num and returns a value equal to num + 3.

Create a function timesFive that accepts one argument, multiplies it by 5, and returns the new value.

```function timesFive(num){
return num * 5;
}
const answer = timesFive(7);
```
# Local Scope and Functions
Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters, have local scope. That means they are only visible within that function.

Here is a function myTest with a local variable called loc.

function myTest() {
  const loc = "foo";
  console.log(loc);
}

myTest();
console.log(loc);
The myTest() function call will display the string foo in the console. The console.log(loc) line (outside of the myTest function) will throw an error, as loc is not defined outside of the function.

The editor has two console.logs to help you see what is happening. Check the console as you code to see how it changes. Declare a local variable myVar inside myLocalScope and run the tests.

Note: The console will still display ReferenceError: myVar is not defined, but this will not cause the tests to fail.

```function myLocalScope() {
  // Only change code below this line
let myVar
  console.log('inside myLocalScope', myVar);
}
myLocalScope();

// Run and check the console
// myVar is not defined outside of myLocalScope
console.log('outside myLocalScope', myVar);
```

# Golf Code
In the game of Golf, each hole has a par, meaning, the average number of strokes a golfer is expected to make in order to sink the ball in the hole to complete the play. Depending on how far above or below par your strokes are, there is a different nickname.

Your function will be passed par and strokes arguments. Return the correct string according to this table which lists the strokes in order of priority; top (highest) to bottom (lowest):

Strokes	Return
1	"Hole-in-one!"
<= par - 2	"Eagle"
par - 1	"Birdie"
par	"Par"
par + 1	"Bogey"
par + 2	"Double Bogey"
>= par + 3	"Go Home!"
par and strokes will always be numeric and positive. We have added an array of all the names for your convenience.

```const names = ["Hole-in-one!", "Eagle", "Birdie", "Par", "Bogey", "Double Bogey", "Go Home!"];

function golfScore(par, strokes) {
  // Only change code below this line 
  if (strokes == 1) {
    return names[0]
  } else if (strokes <= par - 2) {
    return names[1]
  } else if (strokes == par - 1) {
    return names[2]
  } else if (strokes == par) {
    return names[3]
  } else if (strokes == par + 1) {
    return names[4]
  } else if (strokes == par + 2) {
    return names[5]
  } else if (strokes >= par + 3) {
    return names[6]
  }


  return "Change Me";
  // Only change code above this line
}

golfScore(5, 4);
```
# Selecting from Many Options with Switch Statements
If you have many options to choose from, use a switch statement. A switch statement tests a value and can have many case statements which define various possible values. Statements are executed from the first matched case value until a break is encountered.

Here is an example of a switch statement:

switch (lowercaseLetter) {
  case "a":
    console.log("A");
    break;
  case "b":
    console.log("B");
    break;
}
case values are tested with strict equality (===). The break tells JavaScript to stop executing statements. If the break is omitted, the next statement will be executed.

Write a switch statement which tests val and sets answer for the following conditions:
1 - alpha
2 - beta
3 - gamma
4 - delta
```function caseInSwitch(val) {
  let answer = "";
  // Only change code below this line
switch (val){
  case 1:
  answer = "alpha";
  break;
  case 2:
  answer = "beta";
  break;
  case 3:
  answer = "gamma";
  break;
  case 4:
  answer = "delta";
  break;
}


  // Only change code above this line
  return answer;
}
```
# Count Backwards With a For Loop
A for loop can also count backwards, so long as we can define the right conditions.

In order to decrement by two each iteration, we'll need to change our initialization, condition, and final expression.

We'll start at i = 10 and loop while i > 0. We'll decrement i by 2 each loop with i -= 2.

const ourArray = [];

for (let i = 10; i > 0; i -= 2) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}
ourArray will now contain [10, 8, 6, 4, 2]. Let's change our initialization and final expression so we can count backwards by twos to create an array of descending odd numbers.

Push the odd numbers from 9 through 1 to myArray using a for loop.

```

const myArray = [];
for (let i = 9; i > 0; i -= 2) {
  myArray.push(i);
}
```
# Iterate with JavaScript Do...While Loops
The next type of loop you will learn is called a do...while loop. It is called a do...while loop because it will first do one pass of the code inside the loop no matter what, and then continue to run the loop while the specified condition evaluates to true.

const ourArray = [];
let i = 0;

do {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
The example above behaves similar to other types of loops, and the resulting array will look like [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. However, what makes the do...while different from other loops is how it behaves when the condition fails on the first check. Let's see this in action. Here is a regular while loop that will run the code in the loop as long as i < 5:

const ourArray = []; 
let i = 5;

while (i < 5) {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
}
In this example, we initialize the value of ourArray to an empty array and the value of i to 5. When we execute the while loop, the condition evaluates to false because i is not less than 5, so we do not execute the code inside the loop. The result is that ourArray will end up with no values added to it, and it will still look like [] when all of the code in the example above has completed running. Now, take a look at a do...while loop:

const ourArray = []; 
let i = 5;

do {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
In this case, we initialize the value of i to 5, just like we did with the while loop. When we get to the next line, there is no condition to evaluate, so we go to the code inside the curly braces and execute it. We will add a single element to the array and then increment i before we get to the condition check. When we finally evaluate the condition i < 5 on the last line, we see that i is now 6, which fails the conditional check, so we exit the loop and are done. At the end of the above example, the value of ourArray is [5]. Essentially, a do...while loop ensures that the code inside the loop will run at least once. Let's try getting a do...while loop to work by pushing values to an array.

Change the while loop in the code to a do...while loop so the loop will push only the number 10 to myArray, and i will be equal to 11 when your code has finished running.
```
function multiplyAll(arr) {
  let product = 1;
  // Only change code below this line
for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
 for(let j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++){
 product *= arr[i][j];

 }
 
}

  // Only change code above this line
  return product;
  
}
console.log(multiplyAll([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6, 7]]));
multiplyAll([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6, 7]]);
```
# Generate Random Fractions with JavaScript
Random numbers are useful for creating random behavior.

JavaScript has a Math.random() function that generates a random decimal number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). Thus Math.random() can return a 0 but never return a 1.

Note: Like Storing Values with the Assignment Operator, all function calls will be resolved before the return executes, so we can return the value of the Math.random() function.

Change randomFraction to return a random number instead of returning 0.
```
function randomFraction() {

  // Only change code below this line

  return Math.random();

  // Only change code above this line
}
```
# Generate Random Whole Numbers with JavaScript
It's great that we can generate random decimal numbers, but it's even more useful if we use it to generate random whole numbers.

Use Math.random() to generate a random decimal.
Multiply that random decimal by 20.
Use another function, Math.floor() to round the number down to its nearest whole number.
Remember that Math.random() can never quite return a 1 and, because we're rounding down, it's impossible to actually get 20. This technique will give us a whole number between 0 and 19.

Putting everything together, this is what our code looks like:

Math.floor(Math.random() * 20);
We are calling Math.random(), multiplying the result by 20, then passing the value to Math.floor() function to round the value down to the nearest whole number.

Use this technique to generate and return a random whole number between 0 and 9.
```
function randomWholeNum() {

  // Only change code below this line

  return Math.floor(Math.random()*10);
}
```
# Generate Random Whole Numbers within a Range
Instead of generating a random whole number between zero and a given number like we did before, we can generate a random whole number that falls within a range of two specific numbers.

To do this, we'll define a minimum number min and a maximum number max.

Here's the formula we'll use. Take a moment to read it and try to understand what this code is doing:

Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min
Create a function called randomRange that takes a range myMin and myMax and returns a random whole number that's greater than or equal to myMin, and is less than or equal to myMax, inclusive.

```
function randomRange(myMin, myMax) {
  // Only change code below this line
  
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (myMax - myMin + 1) + myMin);

  // Only change code above this line
}
```

# Use the parseInt Function
The parseInt() function parses a string and returns an integer. Here's an example:

const a = parseInt("007");
The above function converts the string 007 to the integer 7. If the first character in the string can't be converted into a number, then it returns NaN.

Use parseInt() in the convertToInteger function so it converts the input string str into an integer, and returns it.
```
function convertToInteger(str) {
return parseInt (str);
}

convertToInteger("56");
```
